# A few words about me

My name is **Nikolaos Papachristou** and I am currently finishing my PhD on "Machine Learning for Exploring and Predicting Cancer Symptom Clusters" at the Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP), University of Surrey. My supervisor is Professor [Payam Barnaghi](http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/P.Barnaghi/), my co-supervisor is Dr [Sarah Allison](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/nutrition/People/154416/), and my external supervisor is Professor [Christine Miaskowski](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/christine.miaskowski) (University of California, San Francisco). 

You can have an overview of my PhD research in my public presentation about ["Data analysis in oncology for predicting cancer patients' symptoms during their chemotherapy treatment", 3rd Health Innovation Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hMLdn9D2Hc) (the slides are in English but the presentation is in Greek).

In this repository I maintain my personal Github page, where I upload some of **_healthcare data science/machine learning/AI experiments_**. 

Please have a look, also, to [my personal blog](https://nikolaospapachristou.github.io/). During my first steps in social media, somewhere around 2007, I adapted the alias _ehealthgr_. Since then, my main professional and research interests have been the integration of Information and Communications Technology in Medicine, Biomedical Science, Clinical and Healthcare Services Research. Through evidence synthesis I try to identify important biomedical/clinical/health services/wellness questions and with the use of data science/machine learning/AI I try to provide insights and practical solutions to them.

As a researcher I have worked in designing and evaluating Medical eLearning Systems, implementing a mixed methods study and evaluating patient safety of the healthcare services (i.e., primary care, cancer care, dementia care) in North West London. I have been trained and practiced Evidence Synthesis through systematic reviews, Technology Assessment through quantitative (e.g. regression analysis, analytical modelling) and qualitative methods (e.g. active evaluation, ground theory, thematic analysis). Finally, I have been exploring novel applications of machine learning and network analysis on cancer symptom clusters. 

Before my current position I have worked as a research assistant in the Global eHealth Unit of Imperial College London. I have also worked as a Medical Laboratory Technologist/Biomedical Scientist in a hospital, and did e-learning and AI research at University of Patras.
