My name is Nikolaos Papachristou and I am currently finishing my PhD on "Machine Learning for Exploring and Predicting Cancer Symptom Clusters" at the Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP), University of Surrey. My supervisor is Professor [Payam Barnaghi](http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/P.Barnaghi/), my co-supervisor is Dr [Sarah Allison](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/nutrition/People/154416/), and my external supervisor is Professor [Christine Miaskowski](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/christine.miaskowski) (University of California, San Francisco). 

You can find the full list of my publications at Google Scholar, ResearchGate and ORCID. 

As a researcher I have worked in designing and evaluating Medical eLearning Systems, implementing a mixed methods study and evaluating patient safety of the healthcare services (i.e., primary care, cancer care, dementia care) in North West London. I have been trained and practiced Evidence Synthesis through systematic reviews, Technology Assessment through quantitative (e.g. regression analysis, analytical modelling) and qualitative methods (e.g. active evaluation, ground theory, thematic analysis). Finally, I have been exploring novel applications of machine learning and network analysis on cancer symptom clusters. 

Before my current position I have worked as a research assistant in the Global eHealth Unit of Imperial College London. I have also worked as a Medical Laboratory Technologist/Biomedical Scientist in a hospital, and did e-learning and AI research at University of Patras.

So far, I have studied Medical Laboratory Technology/Biomedical Science (BSc), Life Science Informatics (MSc), Health Technology Assessment (MSc), Education and Pedagogy (Diploma).

From 2012 to 2013 I had the opportunity to experience digital health entrepreneurship on a venture for Childhood Asthma, winning second place at the “Call to Innovation Greece”. I have tried to supplement my knowledge and skills on Digital Health Interventions Design for Chronic Diseases such as Asthma through multidisciplinary digital health workshops (MIT Health and Wellness Innovation 2013), Conferences (Futuremed 2013) and various assignments on courses for Implementation Science and Mobile Health.
